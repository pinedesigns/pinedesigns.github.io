We've been working on our latest products, and now they're finally out. Introducing... The brand new **[low-poly pineapple range!][low-poly-triangulated-pineapple-range]**
First of all, for those of you who aren't familiar with low-poly art, it is pretty much art created by simplifying images into colored triangles.

We are selling this design on a huge range of items including clothing, mugs, stickers, stationery, phone cases, clocks and even decks of cards (you never know). We hope you enjoy, and don't forget to tell us what you think [via email][contact] or in our [comments section][comments].

**[You can check out the range here.][low-poly-triangulated-pineapple-range]**  
Enjoy!
